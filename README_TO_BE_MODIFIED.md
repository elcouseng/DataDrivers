# DS311-Group-Project-Documentation

## Objectives
This group project is designed to bring first hand data-driven project experience to students. Students should be applying what they've learned in this course to explore the dataset of their choice. Students need to collaborate with their group memebers in this project for building their project management skills.  I recommend students to treat this project as the fundation of their profolio project for future interview. The more you contribute to the project, the better you can explain it in the future interviews. 

## Dataset
Students are provided with 4 datasets from different industries as described below.  Each dataset can be used to answer some specific business questions.  Each group needs to choose one out of the four to explore, analyze, and complete the story-telling presentation. You can find the datasets and the full description from this repository.

1. Dognition Subscription-Based Web Service Data (dognition folder)
2. Data-Drive Industry Salary Data (salary folder)
3. FIFA World Cup Data (sport folder)
4. Online Cars Sale Marketplace Data (sale folder)

## Technologies & Tools
Students are expected to perform the EDA analysis or other scientific analysis using the technologies and data science tools covered in this course.  They include, but not limited to, Python, SQL, R, Git, Tableau, Markdown, Business Dashboard, Story-Telling, etc. There is no requirement on what technology must be applied in your analytic process, but at least one of the three main tools (Python, R, or Tableau) should be used for the data analysis.  

Plot (or graph) is often perferred over tables or text description. Make sure to include some intuitive data visualizations in your final report and presentation. There are some nice visualization pacakges covered in this course such as MatPlotLib (Python), ggplot2 (R), and Tableau in general.  Make sure you discuss with your group members to create the plots that is best presenting the idea or summarizing the data.

## Git Collaboration
The group project **MUST** be a GitHub repository. Instructor will track the group members' commits (or contribution) to the project weekly. If you plan to contribute to the project by the end of the semester, I promise you will receive a very very very bad grade in this assignment.  I don't need students to contribute every week, but students should be actively contributing to the project (like at least once in 2 weeks).  Each group should assign work to each member every week and track their progress regularly.  If there is an issue or problem, it should be brought up to the group immediately.  If the group cannot resolve the problem internally, the group shoudl discuss with their instructor.  There is no excuse for not contributing to the project regularly and every issue or problem should be documented on the Slack group channel.

Note: Keep in mind that you should never submit a **pull request** to the *remote main* branch until you completed the task you are responsible for.  You can commit your changes locally and push upstream to your own development branch, but don't submit the **pull request** until you are certain about your work is done.  For example, if your team assign you to create 3 plots this week, you can commit each plot individually to the local branch and push them upstream to your remote branch. Once you checked and confirmed all your plots are correct, then you can make the final push to the upstream remote branch and submit a pull request for your team members to review and approve your work.

## Presentation
Each team will have to do a short 15 - 20 minutes presentation.  The purpose of the presentation is to provide students an opportunity to practice their collaboration and story-telling skills. The presentation metrics will be provided to students later in the semester.  Generally speaking, each team needs to practice their presentation and make sure the messages can be delivered within the time limit.

## Submission
The final project report and presentation material should be pushed to the project repository on GitHub.  To submit your final project, each team needs to submit only one GitHub repository link to Canvas.  Do not submit any data file, notebook file, script file, image file, markdown file, document file, etc to Canvas.  All you need to submit is the link to the project repository.

## References
- Two project reports from the previous semester are included in this repository for your reference.
